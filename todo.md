# Todo
- move memory alignment functions from cpu into mmu (common/utility)
- add cartridge and bios classes, parse cartridge header
- add proper descriptions to cpu tests / cleanup tests
- test if storing arm handler functions in a static lut is faster than switch
- test if using templates for flag heavy instructions helps with performance
